OpenAg UI
=========

The control panel for the OpenAg Food Computer (v1.1 and above).


Using
-----


__Run all the shell commands inside the Raspberry Pi.__

#### Optional: install nodejs/npm
tl;dr: [Installing Node.js via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions)

`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`

### Get the code

`$ git clone https://github.com/OpenAgInitiative/openag_ui`

### Build and Deploy the UI
```
$ cd openag_ui
$ npm install
$ npm run couchapp_deploy --app_db_url="http://localhost:5984/app"
```
### Access the UI
Open your browser to `http://${IP_OF_FOOD_COMPUTER}:5984/app/_design/app/_rewrite`.


Browser Support
---------------

The UI targets support for the following browsers:

- Firefox 47+
- Chrome 49+
- IE 11+
- Edge 14+
- Safari 9.1+
- iOS Safari 9.2
- Android 51
- Chrome for Android 51


Developing
----------

**Note:** these steps are only necessary if you are a developer who wants to help build the UI. If you just want to use the UI, all you need to do is [follow this link](http://openaginitiative.github.io/openag_ui/).

Want to contribute? Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/OpenAgInitiative/openag-ui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

We use a handful of front-end tools written in Node to bundle modules and compile new ES6 features into boring vanilla JavaScript. To do development work on the front-end, you'll need to set up these tools.

Prerequisites:

- [Node](http://nodejs.org)
- NPM (comes bundled with Node)

Install:

    cd ~/path/to/openag_ui/
    npm install

Build:

    npm run build

This will generate a folder called `./dist` containing everything necessary for the app to run in your browser. Copy `dist` wherever you like, or drag/drop `dist/index.html` on to your browser to run the app.

If you're doing active development, and want your JS files to automatically rebuild after you save, you can run

    npm run develop

This command will also generate source maps for the Javascript files.

The front-end can also log all the messages that go through the system to the console. This is useful for debugging, since the UI is deterministic and will reproduce the same UI for the same messages. To turn on this feature, add `?log=true` to the end of the url.

    http://example.com/?log=true

Deploying CouchApp
------------------

When doing development, you can deploy the result as a "CouchApp" -- a set of attachments stored in a CouchDB design document. This is how we host the UI on the Food Computer.

    npm run couchapp_deploy --app_db_url="http://localhost:5984/app"

The `app_db_url` parameter is optional, and will default to `http://raspberrypi:5984/app`.
The UI should be available at `http://${IP_OF_FOOD_COMPUTER}:5984/app/_design/app/_rewrite`
